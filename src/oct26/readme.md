## Encapsulation

Data Hiding

 --Getter
 --Setter
 

## Inheritence

Code - reusability


## Benifits of a package

It helps in a name conflict as we can use same name class in different packages

## Why multiple inheritence is not allowed

It creates ambiguity

## Interfaces

only definition till JAVA 8
but after JAVA 8

## signature

public void sum(int a, int b)

signature is sum(int,int)

## Method Overloading

signature needs to be different 
return types is not included in signature


## Method Overiding
@override --- checks whether it is a condition of override or not

exactly same as parent class including return type but change logic
